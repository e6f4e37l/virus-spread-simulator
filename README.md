# Overview
This simulation uses [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) and [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to visualize the spread of a disease through a population of 100. It is intended to demonstrate that pandemic safety/prevention policies actually work to lower R<sub>0</sub> ([basic reproductive number](https://youtu.be/5TJ8RJiQPYA)) of a virus and how that relates to easing the spread of the virus.

The basic idea is to lower R<sub>0</sub> below 1, which will both greatly lower the load on hospitals by "flattening the curve" and slow the spread.
# Variable "policies"
There are a series of "policies" that can be modified to demonstrate how policies may acutally help "flatten the curve" and ease the pandemic:
* Infection Rate
* % People Quarantining
* Testing Period
* Recovery Period
* Hospital Capacity
The results of changing each and its relation to the real world are shown in the following table:

| "Policy"              | Change to Decrease R<sub>0</sub> | Reason                              | Application IRL                         |
| :---------------------|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Infection Rate        | Decrease                         | test                                | test                                    |
| % People Qurantining  | Increase                         | test                                | test                                    |
| Testing Period        | Decrease                         | test                                | test                                    |
| Recovery Period       | Decrease                         | test                                | test                                    |
| Hospital Capacity     | Increase                         | test                                | test                                    |
