# Overview
This simulation uses [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) and [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to help visualize the spread of a disease through a population of 100. It is intended to demonstrate that pandemic safety/prevention policies actually work.
# Policies that can be varied
There are a series of policies that can be modified to demonstrate how policies may acutally help "flatten the curve" and ease the pandemic:
* Infection Rate
* % People Quarantining
* Testing Period (days)
* Recovery Period (days)
* Hospital Capacity
